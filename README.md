# Tantivy Examples on the Web

this repo automatically converts [Tantivy](https://github.com/quickwit-oss/tantivy)'s [examples](https://github.com/quickwit-oss/tantivy/tree/main/examples) to web pages using docco and publishes them using Github Pages.

[see the examples here](https://gregsadetsky.github.io/tantivy-examples-docs/)

---

the original repo which converted Tantivy docs to web pages is [here](https://github.com/tantivy-search/tantivy-search.github.io) -- unfortunately, some of the examples there are a little bit out of date.

additionally, this repo runs the conversion automatically daily, while the repo above needs to be re-run/re-published by hand.

no dig on the original work! this is 10000% inspired/based on it. thanks for the idea!
